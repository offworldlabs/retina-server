/* ── Ground-truth objects in the frontend animation stores.
 *
 * The map keeps four per-object stores — fixesRef (server fix + anchor time),
 * smoothRef (60 fps dead-reckoned position), and two trail buffers — all keyed
 * by one string.  Radar tracks key on their ICAO hex.  In simulation a radar
 * track carries the *same* hex as the aircraft that produced it, so if truth
 * used the bare hex too, the radar ingest and the truth ingest would write one
 * key and the marker would alternate between the solved position and the true
 * one on every 1 Hz update — measured 29.8 km apart for a single-node arc
 * track on staging, which is what "the blue dots jump around" was.
 *
 * Truth therefore lives under a namespaced key while `hex` on the object stays
 * the real hex, so labels, selection and error computation are unaffected.
 * `_key` is the store key and is what the animation loop must index by. ── */
