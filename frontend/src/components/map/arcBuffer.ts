// Detection-arc afterglow buffer — pure keying / upsert logic.
//
// Extracted from useAircraftFeed (hooks.ts) so the keying decision is
// testable without mounting the hook.  The buffer maps key → entry; the
// renderer (DetectionArcs) draws one polyline per entry, each fading on its
// own clock (entry.ts).
//
// Keying: `${hex}-${node_id}-d<delay quantized to 0.1 µs>`.  Keying by the
// MEASURED delay (not the ingest timestamp) means a re-ingest of an unchanged
// measurement refreshes ONE polyline's fade clock instead of stacking a new
// offset stroke — staging measured 180/190 consecutive ticks where delay_us
// was unchanged while the old timestamp keying laid 5 concurrent parallel
// strokes per (hex, node).  A changed delay maps to a new key and lays a new
// entry: that is the genuine afterglow trail.
//
// Entries without a usable delay_us fall back to timestamp keying
// (`…-t<ingest ms>`) — the old behavior — because there is no measurement
// value to dedupe on; these keep the original same-millisecond-collision
// guard (skip rather than overwrite, so an existing entry keeps fading from
// its original ts).
