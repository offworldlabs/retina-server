/* ── DetectionArcs: imperative Leaflet polylines with timer-driven opacity fade.

      Each arc in the buffer is rendered as its own polyline that fades on
      its own clock — producing a radar-style afterglow trail behind a moving
      target. Each polyline fades linearly to zero over ARC_FADE_MS.  Tick
      interval is 250 ms which is enough resolution for visibly smooth decay
      without React re-render cost. ── */
