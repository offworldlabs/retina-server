# Simulation Layer

The fleet simulator (`libs/retina-simulation`) runs synthetic radar nodes and
injects real or simulated aircraft traffic to exercise the full server
pipeline. It powers the staging/testmap surfaces and CI.

## Architecture

```
FleetOrchestrator (retina_simulation/orchestrator.py)
    │
    ├─ SimulationWorld          (shared physics state, world.py)
    │       ├─ SimulatedAircraft × N
    │       └─ node views              (per-node observation geometry)
    │
    ├─ AdsbLolClient            (optional real ADS-B feed)
    │
    ├─ config poller            (GET /api/simulation/config every 5 s)
    │
    └─ NodeConnection × M       (async TCP, one per node)
            │
            └─ HELLO → CONFIG → DETECTION / HEARTBEAT
```

All nodes share a single `SimulationWorld`. Each node observes the world
through its own geometry: position, beam azimuth, a **fixed 42° Yagi
half-power beamwidth** (the whole fleet is the same antenna — width jitter was
removed deliberately), and range. The detection cone honours
`max_bistatic_range_km` — the *differential-range* limit — matching the rule
the server's association and arc layers gate on; the monostatic RX-radius rule
is only a fallback for nodes that declare no bistatic limit.

---

## Scene generation (`generator.py`)

The generator places nodes and picks illuminators for a metro scene:

- **`--metro gvl`** scopes the scene to one metro (Greenville, SC is the
  deployed default): sites inside the metro radius, aircraft on the metro's
  regional waypoint net, real ADS-B polling confined to its bounding box.
- **`--layout ring | dual | scatter`** — ring places nodes around the core;
  dual gives each site two illuminators; scatter (the staging default)
  distributes sites with per-site reach drawn from a distribution
  (60 km differential is what a *good* setup achieves, not an average one).
- **Illuminators are real FCC sites** — the GVL table carries the actual
  broadcast towers (WYFF Caesars Head etc.); base-metro nodes draw from the
  cached `metro_tower_cache.json` FCC lookups. Receiver sites are synthetic,
  land-checked (Natural Earth coastline/lake polygons) positions.

Detections carry bistatic delay and Doppler computed from full 3D ENU
geometry (altitude included — which is why the server's arc builder solves a
3D locus), plus SNR. **Known simplification:** SNR falls off at a one-way
10 dB/decade rather than the bistatic ~40 dB/decade, so synthetic SNR is
optimistic at range; SNR-derived gates need re-tuning on real captures.
Clutter/false alarms are injected with small-differential bias (they cluster
near the TX–RX baseline, which is why the server floors tiny differentials
before drawing arcs).

## Runtime simulation config

The orchestrator polls `GET /api/simulation/config` every 5 s. The Physics
tab (or `PUT /api/simulation/config`, admin-authed) can change at runtime:

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|-----|---------|---------|
| `frac_anomalous` | 0.0 | Fraction of spawns with anomalous behaviour |
| `frac_drone` | 0.0 | Drone fraction (off by default; enable for drone scenarios) |
| `frac_dark` | 0.15 | Non-ADS-B ("dark") fraction |
| `min_aircraft` / `max_aircraft` | *(unset)* | Steady-state aircraft bounds |
| `n_nodes` / `dual_fraction` / `max_range_km` | *(unset)* | Fleet-scene keys — applying one **restarts the fleet** for regeneration |

The fractions and aircraft counts apply in-process to *new spawns*. The scene
keys are different: node count, dual-illuminator fraction and a uniform range
override (`max_range_km`, `0` = per-node generated ranges) shape the node
configs themselves, so the orchestrator compares the polled value against its
running scene and shuts down for regeneration on drift;
`deploy/fleet-entrypoint.sh` fetches the overrides on reboot. The Physics
tab keeps these under the Fleet Scene section with its restart warning.

The unset keys are **deliberately absent from the defaults**: the fleet
applies them only when explicitly set, otherwise its deployment env
(`FLEET_MIN_AIRCRAFT` etc.) wins. Defaults here once carried a stale fleet
scale that silently overrode the deployment the first time anyone touched an
unrelated knob. The world's own constructor defaults are kept matched to this
table (drones once defaulted to 0.10 in the world, spawning a few boot-window
drones on every fleet restart even with the slider at 0). The runtime config
is in-memory only — a backend restart returns it to these defaults.

---

## Aircraft lifecycle

Spawns roll a target class from the fractions, get a route (85% metro-cell
traffic on the regional waypoint net under `--metro`) and a lifetime of
180–900 s (drones 60–300 s). Expiry never removes an aircraft mid-view: an
expired non-drone is rerouted to a waypoint past `retire_edge_km` (70 km) on
the bearing away from the world center and retires only once beyond that
edge — the viewer watches it leave. A 900 s exit grace backstops genuinely
stuck aircraft; drones keep the old 2×-lifetime churn (an amber X-frame
vanishing reads as turnover, not a tracking bug). On the map, ADS-B truth
dots are near-black and dark aircraft grey: truth is the reference the solved
lanes are measured against, so it is deliberately the one thing out there
wearing no lane colour.

---

## Deployed fleet (staging)

Staging's fleet container regenerates `fleet_config.json` from `FLEET_*` env
on every boot (`deploy/fleet-entrypoint.sh`); scale changes are compose-file
changes, not code changes. Current staging scale (`docker-compose.staging.yml`):

| Env | Value | Meaning |
|-----|-------|---------|
| `FLEET_METRO` | `gvl` | Greenville, SC scene |
| `FLEET_LAYOUT` | `scatter` | Scatter site layout |
| `FLEET_NODES` | 30 | Total synthetic nodes |
| `FLEET_N_CLUSTER` | 20 | Scatter-cluster size |
| `FLEET_MIN_AIRCRAFT` / `FLEET_MAX_AIRCRAFT` | 20 / 40 | Steady-state traffic |
| `FLEET_MODE` | `adsb` | Merge the real ADS-B feed |
| `FLEET_INTERVAL` | 0.5 s | Frame interval per node |

Two real hardware nodes (`radar3*-retnode`, via the blah2 bridge near
Atlanta) connect alongside the synthetic fleet; their geometry lives in
`backend/config/blah2_nodes.json` (42° Yagis) with a runtime overlay copy
under `backend/data/runtime/`.

---

## Real ADS-B Feed (`AdsbLolClient`)

With `--mode adsb`, a background task polls `api.adsb.lol` for the metro's
bounding box every 10 s and merges results into the world: hexes matching a
simulated aircraft update it in place; new hexes join as real aircraft.
Ground truth (positions + per-object metadata) is pushed to the server
(`POST /api/sim/ground-truth`) for accuracy evaluation and the debug-truth
map layer.

---

## TCP Protocol (NodeConnection)

```jsonc
// 1. HELLO (client → server)
{"type": "HELLO", "version": "1.0", "node_id": "synth-GVL-SCAT-0001"}

// 2. CONFIG (client → server) — carries the full node geometry, including
//    beam_azimuth_deg / beam_width_deg / max_range_km / max_bistatic_range_km.
//    The server threads these into its per-node pipelines, arc builder and
//    inter-node association — dropping any of them regresses those layers
//    to defaults, so the CONFIG payload is the geometry contract.
{"type": "CONFIG", "node_id": "...", "config": { ... }, "config_hash": "abc123"}

// 3. CONFIG_ACK (server → client)
{"type": "CONFIG_ACK", "status": "ok", "node_id": "synth-GVL-SCAT-0001"}

// 4. DETECTION (client → server, every frame_interval seconds)
{
  "type": "DETECTION",
  "node_id": "synth-GVL-SCAT-0001",
  "timestamp": 1711800000000,
  "delay": [45.2, 78.1],
  "doppler": [22.3, -18.7],
  "snr": [21.4, 15.2],
  "adsb": [{"hex": "a1b2c3", "lat": 34.9, "lon": -82.4, "alt_baro": 8000, "gs": 450, "track": 270}]
}

// 5. HEARTBEAT (client → server, when no detections)
{"type": "HEARTBEAT", "node_id": "...", "timestamp": ...}
```

The server sends no response after `CONFIG_ACK`; subsequent messages are
unidirectional node → server.

## Running the Fleet Locally

```bash
# Greenville scene matching staging's shape, against a local backend
python3 -m retina_simulation.orchestrator \
  --nodes 30 --metro gvl --layout scatter --n-cluster 20 \
  --mode adsb --interval 0.5 \
  --min-aircraft 20 --max-aircraft 40 \
  --host localhost --port 3012 --seed 42
```

Key parameters:

| Flag | Default | Effect |
|------|---------|--------|
| `--nodes` | 200 | Total synthetic nodes to generate |
| `--metro` | (none) | Scope scene + traffic + ADS-B to one metro |
| `--layout` | `ring` | Site layout: `ring`, `dual`, `scatter` |
| `--n-cluster` | — | Scatter cluster size |
| `--interval` | 5.0 s | Seconds between detection frames per node |
| `--time-scale` | 1.0 | Simulation speed multiplier |
| `--concurrency` | 20 | Max simultaneous TCP connects at startup |
| `--min-aircraft` / `--max-aircraft` | 5 / 20 | Aircraft count range (runtime config can override) |
| `--seed` | — | Deterministic scene generation |

Beam width needs no flag: every antenna is the 42° Yagi. `--beam-width-deg`
exists only as an explicit override for experiments.
