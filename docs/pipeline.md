# Detection Pipeline

The core processing chain that takes raw detection frames from nodes and produces
positioned aircraft in the output feed.

## 1. TCP Frame Ingestion

Each node maintains a persistent TCP connection to the server on port 3012.
Frames arrive as newline-delimited JSON and go through a handshake sequence:

```
HELLO  →  CONFIG (node sends its geometry/freq config)
       ←  CONFIG_ACK (server confirms, assigns node_id)

DETECTION  →  (streams indefinitely, one frame per interval)
HEARTBEAT  →  (every 60 s when no detections)
```

On receipt the server does two things in parallel:

1. **ADS-B fast-path**: if the frame contains an `adsb` array, every entry is
   written directly into `state.adsb_aircraft` before the frame touches any
   queue. This keeps the ADS-B map current even if the frame queue is saturated.

2. **Frame queue**: the frame is enqueued for CPU-bound processing by the
   `FRAME_WORKERS` thread pool. `FRAME_WORKERS=8` on the production server.

---

## 2. Kalman Tracker (retina-tracker)

Each node has its own `PassiveRadarPipeline` instance, and inside it a private
`Tracker` instance running standard M-of-N Kalman + GNN association.

**State vector**: `[delay_µs, doppler_Hz]` — the two bistatic observables.

**GNN (Global Nearest Neighbour) association**:
- Predicts each track one step forward with its Kalman filter.
- Builds a cost matrix using Mahalanobis distance as the gating metric.
- Solves the assignment with `scipy.optimize.linear_sum_assignment` (Hungarian).
- SNR-weights costs so high-SNR detections are preferred.
- ADS-B-initialized tracks get a 20% cost bonus to keep them associated.

**Track states** (following blah2 architecture):

| State | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `TENTATIVE` | Newly created, not yet confirmed |
| `ASSOCIATED` | Has received at least one update |
| `ACTIVE` | Promoted via M-of-N; assigned a track ID |
| `COASTING` | Missed last frame; gate expands to recover |

**M-of-N promotion**: a track is promoted from `TENTATIVE` to `ACTIVE` once
`n_associated >= M_THRESHOLD` (default 4) within an N-frame window (default 6).
Only at this point does it receive a stable `track_id` and get emitted to the
event writer for geolocation.

**Tracklet stitching**: when a new detection falls within
`TRACKLET_MAX_DELAY_RESIDUAL` and `TRACKLET_MAX_DOPPLER_RESIDUAL` of a recently
deleted track, it's linked rather than spawning a new hypothesis.

---

## 3. Geolocation (retina-geolocator, LM solver)

After each tracker frame, `_run_geolocation()` asks the event writer which
tracks have new data, then runs the Levenberg–Marquardt solver on each.

**Inputs**: a window of the last 20 detections in `{timestamp, delay_µs, doppler_Hz, snr}` form.
At least 3 detections are required before the solver is called.

**Initial guess**: `select_initial_guess()` uses the bistatic geometry to
enumerate candidate positions along the ellipsoid and picks the one whose
predicted delay/doppler best fits the most recent measurements. On subsequent
frames the previous solution is used as the warm-start (temporal continuity).

**Solver output** (`solve_track()`):
- 6-element state vector: `[east_km, north_km, up_km, vel_east, vel_north, vel_up]`
  all in km / km·s⁻¹, ENU relative to the receiver.
- RMS residuals for delay and Doppler.
- `success: bool` — false if the LM solver diverged or hit iteration limits.

The ENU solution is converted to WGS-84 `(lat, lon, alt_m)` via
`Geometry.ecef2lla` for output.

**Target classification** (per-node):
- `aircraft` — default; also auto-assigned when speed > 60 m/s or alt > 600 m.
- `drone` — speed ≤ 60 m/s and alt ≤ 600 m when `target_profile = "auto"`.
- `drone` profile nodes constrain the initial altitude guess and solver bounds
  for better convergence on slow, low targets.

## 4. Multi-Node Solver

Tracks from different nodes seeing the same target can be combined for a
tighter position fix. Association is **track-level**: each node's confirmed
tracklets (not raw detections) are submitted to the `InterNodeAssociator`
(`retina_analytics.association`), which pairs them across nodes on predicted
delay/Doppler consistency inside precomputed overlap zones, with one-to-one
χ² assignment. Candidate pairs go to the `solver_queue` for the LM multinode
solve (run in a process pool; `retina-geolocator.solve_multinode`, which also
reports per-solve east/north position covariance).

**Top-down claiming** (`ASSOC_CLAIM_MODE`, active on staging): after the
pairing round, established multi-node global tracks predict their expected
delay/Doppler at each node and *claim* matching tracklets directly — matched
tracklets are excluded from fresh pairing and emitted as anchored solver
inputs. This cuts track fragmentation (one stable key per object instead of a
new key per pairing) and recovers solves the bottom-up round would miss.

**Publication gates**, in order, for a converged solve:

- **rms residual / χ² trimming** — contaminated contributing nodes are
  trimmed and the solve retried before rejection.
- **beam/FOV gate** — each contributing node's solution bearing/range must be
  consistent with where that node can see. Under `FOV_MODE=active` this is
  the node's *learned* empirical FOV (section 7); n=2 uses the FOV alone,
  n≥3 uses it widen-only alongside the theoretical range rule.
- **displacement gate + n=2 confirmation** — an n=2 pairing publishes only
  after a constant-velocity fit over its observation window justifies it
  (5 unknowns vs 4 residuals means the residual gates cannot discriminate at
  n=2 on their own).
- **consensus** (`SOLVER_CONSENSUS_MODE`, active on staging) — a
  pairwise-intersection hypothesis stage refines n≥3 solves.

**Identity**: `multinode_key_decision` keys the published track, preferring
the anchor key of the claiming global track (mn-dark keys for targets with no
ADS-B seed) so repeated solves of one object share one identity. Display
positions are smoothed per key (`TRACK_SMOOTHER=kf|ewma|off`, default `kf` —
a CV Kalman filter; `ewma` is the env-only rollback).

Multi-node solved aircraft appear in the output with `type = "multinode_solve"`,
`n_nodes` set, and `contributing_node_ids` listed. No ambiguity arc is emitted
for these since the position is precisely known.

---

## 5. ADS-B Integration

Nodes can piggyback ADS-B data on their detection frames (embedded in the
`adsb` field). The simulation fleet does this for all aircraft that have
`has_adsb = True`.

When a geolocated track has an `adsb_hex` and there's a fresh ADS-B fix in
`state.adsb_aircraft`:
- The displayed position is dead-reckoned from the ADS-B fix rather than
  taken from the LM solver. This is more accurate and smoother.
- `position_source` is set to `"adsb_associated"`.
- No ambiguity arc is emitted — the position is already known precisely.

ADS-B entries expire 60 s after the position was *captured*, which is the
timestamp on the frame that carried it rather than the moment the backend
stored it. The two differ under queue backlog, and it is the capture time that
the staleness gates need. Where a frame carries no usable timestamp, or one
more than `ADSB_CAPTURE_MAX_SKEW_S` from server time, receipt time stands in
and `adsb_capture_ts_fallback` counts it. After expiry the aircraft falls back
to the solver position.

External truth (`state.external_adsb_cache`, polled from adsb.lol) is stamped
the same way, from each feed's own position time, and stays servable for
`EXTERNAL_ADSB_MAX_AGE_S`. Its entries are therefore tens of seconds old by
construction and are refused by the tighter gates, calibration's 10 s among
them.

---

## 6. Aircraft JSON Builder (`build_combined_aircraft_json`)

Runs every 1 s in the `_aircraft_flush_executor` thread. Priority order
for deduplicated hex codes:

1. **Single-node geolocated tracks** (per-node LM solver) — with or without ADS-B.
2. **Multi-node solved tracks** — takes precedence over single-node for the same hex.
3. **ADS-B-only aircraft** — aircraft seen in ADS-B but not yet tracked by radar.
4. **Ground truth** (simulation only) — injected from the fleet orchestrator,
   keyed separately and not displayed as aircraft markers.
5. **Pending detection arcs** — bistatic ellipse arcs for promoted (non-TENTATIVE)
   tracks that don't have a known ADS-B position.

The result is broadcast to all WebSocket clients and written to
`tar1090_data/aircraft.json`.

## 7. Empirical Coverage & Learned FOV

Each node accumulates an empirical picture of where it can actually see
(`retina_analytics.empirical_coverage`, 72 × 5° bearing bins, persisted on the
`coverage_data` volume). Under `FOV_MODE` (`off | shadow | active`) that
learned field-of-view replaces the theoretical beam wedge as the association
grid and solver beam gate; the theoretical beam (declared aim, or the
broadside+90° fallback for nodes that never declared one) is only a *prior*
that binds until a bin has evidence. Broadening is fast (3 ADS-B-calibrated
positives open a bin; 10 extend range to P95 × 1.25); shrinking requires
negative evidence over time (≥3 recorded disappearances spanning ≥10 min,
newer than the bin's last positive) — absence of traffic never shrinks.

**What counts as a calibration positive is deliberately narrow.** The polygon
is used to judge solves and gate association, so it must be built only from
evidence independent of both, and only from *detections*:

- the position recorded is the aircraft's **reported ADS-B fix** (≤ 10 s old,
  `services/calibration.py`) — never a solver output;
- the node's track must have associated a real detection within
  `CAL_DETECTION_FRESH_S` (5 s) and have ≥ 3 detections — a track coasting on
  ADS-B enrichment is not evidence (`track_gates.py`);
- that newest detection must itself carry the track's own ADS-B tag — a track
  that identity-swaps onto an untagged target keeps a stale hex and would
  otherwise record the departed aircraft's position;
- published solves record **nothing** for their contributing nodes: that
  attribution rides on the very association the polygon judges, and under an
  active FOV gate it once formed a ghost → positive → wider-gate feedback
  loop.

`CALIBRATION_SCHEMA` (currently 5) versions what a stored positive *means*;
persisted state with an older schema is discarded and relearned at node
registration, on every deployment, with no operator action (the ledger of
past bumps is in `empirical_coverage.py`).
