# Measured blind, track association takes the n=2-only ghost rate from 92.9% to
# 55.4% at no cost in real tracks.  The fit that makes that work is an ~86 ms LM
# solve, and running it inside the frame worker took staging to 92% frame-queue
# depth with the processor 21 s behind a 6 frame/s feed.  It now runs on the
# solver's own threads, behind its own queue and staleness drop, so the frame
# path keeps only the coarse delay gate — one BLAS contraction per node pair.
#
# This now controls only solver.py's _N2_REQUIRE_CONFIRMED — whether an n=2
# solve must carry a chi2 confirmation before its track is published.  The
