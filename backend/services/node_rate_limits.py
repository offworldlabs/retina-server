"""In-process fixed-window rate limits for the node API, and for probing a
polled radar.

Four limiters, because four things need bounding and they are not the same
thing. The authenticated paths are limited per (node_id, endpoint) and refuse
with a 429: the caller already holds a token, so telling it that it is going too
fast leaks nothing it does not know. Registration has no token, so it is limited
on the node_id in the request body and refuses with the shared 403 rather than a
429. Claiming is authenticated but is bounded on the address as well as the
node, because what it spends is somebody else's mailbox rather than this
server's time. Probing a polled radar is limited per account, because each probe
is a request this server sends to a host the caller chose.

Detections are held to 8 a second, sized against the 2 Hz contract ceiling
rather than the roughly 1.1 Hz measured cadence of D45. A node cannot exceed one
frame per CPI, and sizing this against today's measurement would start refusing
frames the day blah2 gets faster. Heartbeat and config get 30 a minute each,
both being needed precisely when a node is in trouble.

Fixed windows rather than sliding: a node can send double its rate across a
window boundary, which is harmless at these sizes and a great deal easier to
reason about. Only admitted requests are counted, so a caller hammering a closed
window cannot push its reset further out.

The refusal is returned as data rather than a response. The route layer owns
FastAPI; this module owns nothing but a clock and a dict.
