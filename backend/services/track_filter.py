"""Multinode display-track smoother: a per-track-key constant-velocity Kalman
filter over solve positions.

services.tasks.solver publishes one multinode solve at a time, keyed by the
same track key state.multinode_tracks uses (see _MN_TRACKS_LOCK / the
supersession block there).  Each solve has its own position error — GDOP ×
delay noise, worse at n=2 than n=4 — and until now that error was smoothed by
_ewma_smooth_track: dead-reckon up to _MN_HISTORY_K past positions forward to
the current solve time and take an unweighted mean.  That treats every solve
as equally trustworthy, which they are not, and it has no velocity STATE of
its own — the "dead reckoning" is really "recompute from ADS-B/solved
velocity every call and average the results."

This module replaces that with a proper 4-state (east, v_east, north, v_north)
CV Kalman filter, one instance per track key, for three reasons a mean cannot
give you:

  1. Weighted trust.  The solver now attaches a per-solve position covariance
     (cov_en_km2, from retina_geolocator.multinode_solver's Jacobian) — a bad
     GDOP geometry produces a wide covariance and this filter believes that
     solve less, automatically, instead of averaging it in at full weight.
     That Jacobian covariance is only a measurement-noise-propagation LOWER
     BOUND on true solve error, though — it cannot see inter-node frame-time
     skew, association contamination, or pinned-altitude error, which are
     INDEPENDENT of the fit noise, not a scaled version of it.  So the
     covariance is both inflated (_KF_R_INFLATE, for relative weighting
     between a good solve and a bad one) AND added to an unmodeled-error
     floor (_KF_DEFAULT_POS_SIGMA_M, now unconditional) rather than replaced
     by a single flat multiplier — see _measurement_R and the _KF_R_INFLATE
     comment for the staging measurements that made the additive form
     necessary.
  2. Principled dead-reckoning.  The predict step is real KF prediction, not
     a recomputed-every-time projection: the filter's OWN velocity state
     accumulates evidence from every solve's POSITION update (plus an
     explicit velocity measurement from ADS-B when live — see
     _KF_VEL_SIGMA_SOLVE_MS for why the solved CV fit is deliberately NOT
     fed in the same way: it is an init prior only, never a measurement), so
     between-solve gaps are bridged with a growing, honestly-tracked
     uncertainty rather than a fresh point estimate each call.
  3. Honest uncertainty out.  kf_pos_sigma_m on the smoothed result is the
     filter's actual position marginal, not an assumption — callers that want
     to gate on confidence (map rendering, anomaly detectors) get a real
     number instead of nothing.

The filter is EWMA-compatible where it needs to be: first solve for a key is
raw passthrough (no prior to smooth against, exactly like _ewma_smooth_track
returning raw below len(positions) < 2), a gap past _KF_MAX_GAP_S re-anchors
instead of bridging — the same threshold solver.py's _MN_DR_MAX_AGE_S uses
for the same reason (a multi-minute gap is not the same aircraft's
continuous track) — and duplicate/out-of-order timestamps (dt <= 0) are raw
passthrough, same as the EWMA.  That last case is not a rare edge condition
in production: it fires mostly as an association burst, several solves for
one key sharing a single measurement_ts_ms because overlapping single-node
association rounds re-solved the same epoch's measurements.  Fusing those
would double-count the same underlying evidence rather than add independent
information, so a no-op here is intentional, not a gap in the model — see
the comment at the dt <= 0 check in _smooth_kf.

Env gate — TRACK_SMOOTHER, read PER CALL (not cached) so tests can flip it
without reimporting:
    "kf"   (default) — this module's Kalman filter.
    "ewma" — delegate to the caller-supplied legacy _ewma_smooth_track, kept
             around as a fallback in case the KF misbehaves in production in
             a way the EWMA never did.
    "off"  — raw passthrough, no smoothing at all.
    anything else — treated as "kf".

Lock-order constraint: every caller of smooth_solve() holds solver.py's
_MN_TRACKS_LOCK (see the comment at that call site).  _KF_LOCK below is a
LEAF lock — nothing under it may call back into solver.py, acquire
_MN_TRACKS_LOCK, or acquire _MN_POS_HISTORY_LOCK.  Keeping that one-directional
means solver.py -> track_filter is the only lock order that ever exists, so
there is no deadlock to reason about.

# multinode solve carries all three, and they are INDEPENDENT of the formal
# fit noise, not a scaled-up version of it.  Two rounds of staging
# measurement made the shape of the gap unmistakable:
#
#   2026-08-09, round 1: raw Jacobian sigma fed straight into the gate ->
#   only 1/19 multi-solve records actually smoothed (median displacement
#   0.000 km) — ordinary innovations looked like chi²>13.8 identity breaks,
#   so the filter re-anchored almost every solve.  End-to-end error
#   (gt_error_km against frozen ground truth) ran medians of ~3 km at n=3-4.
#
#   round 2 (flat 4x sigma inflation): much better (11/13 smoothed,
#   kf_pos_sigma_m median 407 m) but a live probe of formal pos_sigma_km on
#   real solves showed WHY a single multiplier cannot close this honestly:
#   formal sigma runs a median of 86 m (14 m .. 1.1 km across the
#   distribution) against a true error still measured at ~2.7 km median — a
#   ~31x ratio.  Multiplying the formal sigma by 31x to match the median
#   would nuke the very thing cov_en_km2 is for: a 1.1 km formal sigma and a
#   14 m formal sigma would both saturate to multi-kilometre R and become
#   indistinguishable, throwing away the relative weighting between a good
#   solve and a bad one.  A handful of solves still gate-re-anchored on
#   borderline d² ~14-15 for the same reason — the tail of the formal
#   distribution was still too tight relative to what a flat multiplier could
#   cover without wrecking the head.
#
# The honest model is additive, not multiplicative-only: true solve error is
# the formal (relatively-weighted, inflated) measurement noise term PLUS an
# INDEPENDENT unmodeled-error floor that every solve carries regardless of
# its own GDOP — frame-time skew, association contamination, altitude
# pinning do not shrink just because a solve's baselines happened to be
# well-conditioned.  R = (_KF_R_INFLATE**2) * cov_m2 + diag(_KF_DEFAULT_POS_SIGMA_M**2, ...):
# the base term carries the unmodeled-error floor (same role
# _KF_DEFAULT_POS_SIGMA_M always had as the no-cov fallback — this is why
# cov-absent is now literally the cov=0 limit of one formula, not a separate
# branch), the inflated formal term still carries meaningful relative
# weighting on top of it.  With the defaults above: formal sigma 86 m ->
# R sigma = sqrt((4*86)² + 1200²) ≈ 1248 m; formal sigma 1.1 km -> R sigma =
# sqrt((4*1100)² + 1200²) ≈ 4561 m — a good solve and a bad one four
# quality-orders apart in the formal fit still land roughly 3.6x apart in R,
# not saturated to the same clamp-capped number.
#
# _KF_R_INFLATE is env-tunable so it can be retuned without a deploy as the
# sensor model — frame-time sync, association, altitude pinning — improves
# and the formal covariance becomes a less severe underestimate of the
