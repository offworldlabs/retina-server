    This is where the public and owner paths part company.  ``aircraft_data`` is
    the whole fleet as built; ``public_data`` is the same feed with nodes whose
    owners registered them ``private`` taken out of it (services/publication.py).
    Every unauthenticated surface reads the public one — the full and real-only
    websockets, /api/radar/aircraft, the SSE stream — and the per-owner feed
    below reads the unredacted one, because an owner's own private node is
    precisely what that feed exists to show them.  Splitting here rather than
    inside build_combined_aircraft_json is what makes that possible: the filter
    has to be able to see an entry before deciding the caller may have it.

    Both are stored on state, because a websocket that connects between flushes
    is served its opening snapshot from there (routes/streaming.py) and must get
    the same payload the broadcast would have given it.

    Redacting nothing returns the identical object, so the common case reuses
    the bytes the flush already serialised rather than paying for a second
    orjson pass at 1 Hz.
