"""Daily SQLite backup of users.db to R2 with N-day retention.

Why this exists: users.db holds all auth state — users, invites, claim codes,
node ownership. Losing it means every user has to be re-onboarded by hand,
and any in-flight invites/claim codes vanish. The drive can fail, the
container can be deleted, the WAL/SHM files can desync — none of those are
recoverable from the runtime alone, so the only safe answer is an off-host
copy.

Implementation choices worth flagging:
  - `VACUUM INTO` is the safest snapshot mechanism. It's an online op (no
    locks held), produces a self-consistent file (no -wal/-shm needed), and
    is atomic from the reader's perspective. Plain `cp` of users.db can
    capture a half-committed write if a transaction is in flight.
  - We upload to R2 under `backups/users-db/YYYY-MM-DD.db`. One key per day
    means re-running the task on the same day is idempotent (overwrites,
    same key) and the prefix lists chronologically.
  - Retention is enforced after the upload — we list all backup keys, sort
    by date in the key, and delete anything older than _RETENTION_DAYS. R2
    is the source of truth for what counts as "still retained".
