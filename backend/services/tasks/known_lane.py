"""Known-lane solver: per-hex solves of identity-claimed detections.

The regular pipeline treats identity as an outcome — detections are paired
bottom-up by the delay grid, solved, and only then checked against ADS-B,
with a disagreeing solve rejected and discarded.  That makes known aircraft
the WORST-measured population: exactly the solves that would calibrate the
radar (truth is on file) are the ones the displacement gate deletes, so a
node whose measurements are drifting looks like a node that simply stopped
publishing.

This lane inverts that.  Slice A (the claiming stage) binds detections to
known ADS-B aircraft BEFORE dark association and publishes them into
``state.known_claims``; this module solves each claimed hex from those
detections directly.  Identity gives cross-node correspondence for free —
two claims on the same hex ARE the same aircraft — so the delay-grid pairing
machinery in retina_analytics.association is bypassed entirely, and every
known target with >= 2 claiming nodes produces a solve attempt on EVERY
pass, whatever the outcome — plus an accuracy sample, rationed per hex
because the accuracy store is shared and capped (see _record_accuracy).

FREE SOLVE INVARIANT: the ADS-B fix seeds the initial guess and pins the
altitude, and does NOTHING else.  The solution is never regularized,
weighted, or constrained toward the ADS-B position — the whole point of
this lane is that the residual solver-vs-ADS-B error measures the RADAR
(per-node bias, geometry, association quality), and any prior toward truth
would contaminate that measurement into a tautology.  The displacement gate
here CLASSIFIES (truth_match / ghost); unlike the regular pipeline's, it
never destroys the record or the accuracy sample.

Modes (state.KNOWN_LANE_MODE, owned by slice A; absent means "off"):
  off     — this module does nothing at all.  Same precedent as
            SOLVER_CONSENSUS_MODE / FOV_MODE: off is byte-identical to the
            behaviour that predates the feature.
  shadow  — solve + record outcomes, accuracy samples and counters, but
            never touch the live feed: a shadow run produces comparison
            data with zero behaviour change.
  binding — additionally publish truth_match solves into
            state.multinode_tracks under the hex's own key (mn-adsb-*),
            exactly as today's tagged solves are, superseding the regular
            pipeline's output for that hex.  Ghosts are recorded but never
            published: a displaced solve under a real hex is a wrong map
            marker, the same reason the regular displacement gate exists.

Neither ``state.known_claims`` nor ``state.KNOWN_LANE_MODE`` exists on this
branch — slice A owns core/state.py — so every access goes through getattr
with an inert default, and the counters below are registered onto the state
module at import.  This file must keep working unchanged whether slice A has
merged or not.
