# ~25% of interpreter time between them, the queue draining at ~0.8 items/s,
# and burst tails aging past the 45 s staleness drop.  The threads remain —
# they own the gates, the track claims and the counters, which live in this
# process — but the solve_multinode / fit_constant_velocity calls are shipped
# to child processes so the optimizer runs on its own core.
#
# spawn, not fork: this process is full of threads holding locks, and a forked
# child would inherit them mid-flight.  A spawn child imports only
# retina_geolocator (the submitted functions' module), none of the backend.
#
# The pool is created by start_solver_workers, never at import: tests and the
# offline bench reach the compute inline through the same helper (pool is
# None → direct call), so they pay no child startup and need no teardown.  If
# the pool breaks mid-flight (a child OOM-killed, say) the affected call runs
# inline and the first thread to notice rebuilds the pool for the rest.

# This EWMA machinery is now the TRACK_SMOOTHER=ewma fallback; the default
# smoother is the Kalman filter in services/track_filter.py.
#
# Each multinode solve has position error σ_pos = GDOP × σ_delay.  By
# accumulating K successive solver positions for the same aircraft (identified
# by ICAO hex) and dead-reckoning earlier positions forward to the current
# solve time using ADS-B velocity, we average K independent noise realisations
# and reduce the effective σ_pos by 1/√K.
#
# K=3 frames (every ~40 s) reduces mean error by ~√3 = 1.73×.
#
# Originally gated on n_nodes == 2 only, but the math is N-agnostic — a single
# bad measurement at any N drags that frame's solve off by O(σ × GDOP), and
# multi-frame averaging on the same aircraft pulls the result back to the
# track-mean for the same √K reason.  Production stats showed the apparent
# "N=2 better than N=3" inversion was an artefact of the smoother only being
# applied to N=2; lifting the gate puts every solve on the same footing.
#
# Dead-reckoning prefers ADS-B ground-speed + track (independent of solver
# error) and falls back to the solved velocity when the target is dark.  Dark
# targets are the population where MLAT is the only position source — and they
# used to be the only population excluded from this smoothing (the old code

      1. ADS-B-tagged solves key on the transponder hex — unconditional, and
         this key is also the smoother's history key (_ewma_smooth_track),

         input (top-down claiming, ASSOC_CLAIM_MODE=active) — mn-dark-*,
         still live in `tracks`, and within max_dist_km of THIS solve's own
         result.  That distance check is what closes the
         consensus-anchored-displacement edge case: the n>=3 displacement
         gate at :~1320 already re-anchors to the consensus centroid rather

         converged somewhere else entirely is not honored just because a
         claim was attempted.
      3. Existing DR proximity scan, moved verbatim from the pre-claiming
         track-key logic (now this function): only dark tracks are claimable — an untagged
         solve must never steal the identity of an ADS-B-tagged aircraft
         that happens to be nearby — dead-reckoned forward so a fast target
         is not rejected purely for having moved since its last solve.
      4. Mint.  This key only needs to be unique at birth; every later solve
         associates to it above (by proximity, or by anchor once a claim
         forms), so it stays stable.

# Association is rate-limited per *node*, not per aircraft: every node that can
# see an aircraft emits its own candidate for it inside one
# ASSOC_MIN_INTERVAL_S window, and the fleet's rounds are staggered across that
# window, so one aircraft arrives as several near-identical candidates.
# Measured on the test deployment's fleet shape (50 nodes, 25-40 aircraft,
# 30 s association interval): 139 candidates over 240 s carrying 49 distinct
# (aircraft, window) pairs — 2.84 candidates per aircraft per window, against a
# solver that drains ~0.7/s.
#
# Solving all of them buys nothing.  The extra solves are superseded by the
# next one for the same aircraft (state.mn_superseded), while the queue ages
# past _SOLVER_MAX_QUEUE_AGE_S and aircraft with no solve at all wait behind
# them — the coverage collapse this suppression exists to undo.
#
# A candidate is skipped when EVERY single-node track it is built from was
# already solved within this window at no fewer nodes.  Both halves matter:
# "every track" means a candidate carrying a track nothing has solved yet
# always runs, so an aircraft entering coverage is never suppressed; "no fewer
# nodes" means a wider — better conditioned — view of the same aircraft is
# never held back by a narrower one that happened to arrive first.
#
# "Every" and not "any", which is the rule supersession uses downstream and the
# obvious way to write this.  Measured over 579 candidates / 600 s of the test
# fleet's shape, against a baseline that solves every candidate instantly,
# counting (aircraft, 30 s window) slots that still get at least one solve:
#
#     rule    candidates solved   coverage kept
#     any            21%              58.5%
#     every          47%              87.8%
#
# Duplicates for one aircraft usually carry *overlapping* track sets rather
# than identical ones — each node's round pairs its own tracks with a rotating
# slice of its neighbours' — so "any" also swallows the candidate that is the
# first sighting of a genuinely different aircraft sharing one contaminated
# track.  Half the extra saving comes out of coverage, which is the thing this
# is for.
#
# Sized against the map, not the association cadence: multinode_tracks expire
# at 60 s, so refreshing an aircraft every 12 s leaves four solves' worth of
# margin.  0 disables the suppression entirely.

    The held score is a **best-ever high-water mark**, not the holder's current
    score, and a refusal deliberately does not refresh it.  Two consequences,
    both measured rather than assumed:

    1. A pairing can be refused by its *own* earlier claim.  chi2 is refitted
       every association round over a growing epoch set, so a stable winning
       pairing's score wanders — median drift +0.11 between rounds — and
       upward drift loses to its own high-water mark until the TTL expires.
       Self-lockouts are roughly 30% of all refusals (707 of 2,403 pooled
       over 6 seeds); the rest are genuine competitor losses.

    2. It is nonetheless the better behaviour.  Letting a pairing renew its own
       claim at a worse score raises the bar competitors must beat, so tracks
       change hands more often and every hand-over publishes another track.
       Measured offline, blind, dual/vhf, 6 seeds, pooled AND paired by seed
       (association_bench.py --claim-policy self-refresh): never better on any
       seed, worse on 5 of 6, +3.2 pooled points of track ghost rate
       (73.4% -> 76.6%) and +9.5 at n=2-only (76.2% -> 85.7%; false n=2
       tracks 16 -> 30), at no gain in real tracks (29 both ways).
       Competitor refusals rose 1,696 -> 1,854 — the churn showing up
       directly.

    So the high-water mark is hysteresis: a pairing must keep fitting at least
    as well as its own best to stay published, and a pairing whose fit is
    degrading is one whose accumulated evidence is turning against it.  Keep it,
    and do not "fix" the self-refusal without re-running that sweep.

    Against no arbitration at all (--claim-policy off) the claim is worth
    8.7 pooled points of track ghost rate (82.1% -> 73.4%), better or tied
    on every seed, and cuts false n=2-only tracks 63 -> 16.

    (Earlier revisions of this docstring quoted "refusals 1 -> 21" and
    "worth 3.7 points": both were read off a --repeat run that printed only
    the LAST seed's counters — see Result.merge in association_bench.py.

        # BEARING — the beam-wedge azimuth test.  At n>=3 it killed 105 good
        # solves (<3 km from truth) to stop 8 bad ones (>8 km) — and half of
        # those 8 the displacement gate below catches anyway.  Worse: 316 of
        # the 474 failing-node evaluations had the TRUE detected target
        # outside the gate's wedge even under the most favorable azimuth
        # candidate.  The reason is structural, not a tuning problem — for
        # multi-epoch track association a node's wedge constrains where its
        # detection was MADE, not where the target is *now*, and by
        # publication time it may well have flown out of that beam.  So the
        # bearing test is now n=2-only, where it is the documented

        # real-data n=2 solves.  The learned FOV (empirical_coverage.py)
        # replaces the invented wedge with what the node has actually been
