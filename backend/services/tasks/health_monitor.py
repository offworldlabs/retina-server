"""Periodic health monitor — owns alerting.

Evaluates the shared health checks on a fixed interval (independent of who
polls /api/health) and fires webhook alerts. Tracks which issues are currently
firing so it can:
  - send one alert per condition (keyed by issue type → per-condition cooldown),
  - emit a "resolved" alert when a previously-firing condition clears.

This decouples alerting from the request path: the server alerts on its own
schedule, and a wedged endpoint no longer means silent degradation (a
fully-down process is caught from outside by the DigitalOcean uptime checks;
see claude-shared/docs/runbooks/uptime-monitoring.md).
