"""Geodesy for the backend: one implementation, re-exported.

The primitives live in ``retina_analytics.constants`` because that is where the
canonical spherical haversine and bearing already were, and because the only
other consumer of them is that same library.  This module re-exports them so
backend code has one import site, and adds the adapters that read a *node config
dict* — the shape backend code actually has in hand, and the shape that was
independently re-derived in four places before this existed.

What was here before: six haversines across three different formulas (two of
them flat-earth, answering 0.175% short), six bearings, five bistatic-delay
computations, and roughly fourteen inline dead-reckoning sites using four
different values for kilometres-per-degree.  A position dead-reckoned in one
module and compared against a gate in another disagreed by up to 0.3%.

    ``.get("beam_width_deg", YAGI_BEAM_WIDTH_DEG)``.  Those differ for a config
    carrying ``beam_width_deg: 0`` — the first gives 41°, the second gives a
    node that can see nothing.  The forgiving form wins: a zero beam width is
    always a missing value, never a real antenna.

    ``beam_azimuth_deg`` is None when the node declares no aim *and* has no TX
    to derive broadside from; callers should then skip the bearing test rather
    than invent a direction.

    The four coordinates are passed through as the caller's config holds them,
    a float or None each; see services.node_config.canonical_config, which
    every in-process config goes through. Callers wanting a placed node should
    gate on ``position_status`` first.
