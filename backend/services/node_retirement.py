"""Forget a node that has left the fleet.

Every per-node store in the server is append-only in practice.  Registration
adds, and this module is the only thing that removes: ``state.connected_nodes``
in particular has no other eviction path at all, so a node absent from it is a
node the fleet has genuinely forgotten.  A receiver that is decommissioned, renamed, or replaced
by a different fleet layout therefore keeps its analytics, coverage polygon,
custody chain and reputation for the life of the deployment, and every
subsequent analytics pass, snapshot write and coverage save keeps paying for
it.  Staging showed this directly after a layout change: 10 receivers that no
longer existed were still being iterated and re-saved to disk, and the node
count reported 26 against 16 live.

This is an explicit operation, not a staleness sweep.  A real receiver offline
for a week is still a real receiver whose accumulated coverage we want back
when it returns; only a decision that the node is *gone* should discard it.
``retire_node`` is that decision, and it is irreversible — the coverage
polygon in particular represents observation time that cannot be recreated.

Retiring a node that is currently connected is refused: it would be undone by
the next registration anyway, and it would strip the custody chain of a live
data source mid-session.
