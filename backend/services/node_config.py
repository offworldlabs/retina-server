"""The one configuration validator, shared by registration and PUT /nodes/config.

Bounds are the wire contract's, at version 1.1.1. Three checks are here and not
there because a JSON schema cannot express them: a receiver and illuminator at
the same point give the solver a degenerate baseline; bool is a subclass of int
in Python, so a plain range check accepts True as a latitude of 1; and NaN
compares false against every bound, so it survives a range check untouched.

A leaf on purpose. It takes a dict and returns a dict, knowing nothing of identity,
HTTP or status codes, so both callers can share it and it stays testable without a
database.
