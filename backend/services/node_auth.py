"""Node bearer tokens and the public identifier.

Only the SHA-256 of a bearer is stored: a per-row salted hash could carry neither
a unique index nor a lookup. There is no cache, so revocation takes effect on the
next request rather than needing an invalidation path, and the service is not
pinned to a single uvicorn worker. Twelve nodes at 2 Hz is 24 indexed reads a
second against WAL-mode SQLite, which the read budget absorbs.

Nothing here commits. Registration writes a node, an agreement set, a config
version, a revocation and a token; the route owns that transaction so a failure
part-way through cannot leave a node with its old token revoked and no new one.
