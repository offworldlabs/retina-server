    Without this the dict is boot-state-only: a rebuild reverted whatever the

    at import the fleet's poll loop then pushed those defaults into the
    *running* world within 5 s.  Persisting it makes an applied scene survive
    `docker compose up -d --build`.

    Precedence: a runtime PUT outranks the SIM_FRAC_* env baseline (that is
    the point of persisting it), but a deploy that *changes* SIM_FRAC_* is a
    deliberate change of intent and outranks a stale runtime tweak.  The two
    are separable because the baseline in force at write time travels in the
    snapshot.  A pre-env-seeding snapshot has no recorded baseline, so its
    effective baseline was the hardcoded fallbacks — compare against those.

    `_updated_at` is restored verbatim rather than re-stamped.  The fleet
    applies config only when the polled stamp strictly exceeds its last-seen
    one, so keeping the original value means a fleet that did NOT restart
    alongside the backend (it already holds these values) skips a pointless
    re-apply, while a fleet that DID restart still applies — its last-seen
    stamp resets to 0.0.  Re-stamping to now() would also make every backend
    restart look like an operator edit to the UI's drift detection.
