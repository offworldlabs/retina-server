"""Lightweight webhook alerter — fires HTTP POST on critical events.

Set ALERT_WEBHOOK_URL in .env to enable. Sends a JSON payload to the
configured URL whenever a critical condition is detected.

Deduplicates alerts: same alert_type is not re-sent within ALERT_COOLDOWN_S
seconds (default 300).

Delivery is retried a bounded number of times on 5xx, on transport errors,
and on the two transient 4xx (408 and 429, honouring Retry-After), but never
on an answer only an operator can clear: the remaining 4xx, and a 3xx, since
redirects are not followed. See _fire() for that split and for what each
outcome does to the cooldown reservation.

Settings are read from the environment on each call rather than once at
import. main.py calls load_dotenv() after its service imports, so an
import-time read sees an empty environment on any start that does not
already carry the variables (e.g. a bare `python main.py`), which leaves
alerting silently disabled.

Stays a generic webhook poster rather than a ClickUp client: ALERT_WEBHOOK_URL
carries the destination (including any workspace/channel ids it needs) and
ALERT_WEBHOOK_FORMAT selects the body shape. A second sink is a new format
branch here, not a rewrite. The `clickup_chat` format targets ClickUp's chat
message endpoint, which ClickUp documents as experimental; log_destination()
is the mitigation for that endpoint changing shape or disappearing with no
deploy of ours to blame.
