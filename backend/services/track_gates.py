    The measured delay constrains the target to a bistatic ellipse (foci at
    TX and RX); the aircraft can be anywhere on it that the node could
    actually detect.  The arc is therefore the full ellipse clipped to the
    node's *detection area* — the same region the coverage layer draws and
    ``point_in_beam`` gates on (``node_beam_params`` semantics):

    * the differential-range limit when the node declares
      ``max_bistatic_range_km`` (every point of the ellipse shares the
      measured differential, so this is a single yes/no for the whole
      locus), else the monostatic ``max_range_km`` circle per bearing;
    * the beam wedge when the node genuinely has one — an explicit
      ``beam_azimuth_deg`` or the broadside-of-baseline default, clipped to
      ``beam_width_deg``.  A declared width >= 360° means omnidirectional
      and yields the full closed ellipse.

    Earlier revisions additionally trimmed the arc to a ~25 km blip around
    the track's own position.  That made the drawn segment unrepresentative
    of the actual ambiguity — the aircraft could equally be anywhere else
    on the in-area locus — so the trim is gone: the emitted arc always
    spans the entire detection-area-constrained ellipse.

    Ground-projected, altitude-agnostic by design (2026-08 direction): the
    arc is the raw-measurement locus — a pure function of the node-reported
    delay and its detection-area geometry, nothing else.  A prior revision
    solved a 3-D ellipsoid at the track's known altitude to correct a
    systematic bias against ground truth (median 3.6 km, worst case
    14.9 km); that correction was a target-position estimate stitched onto
    what is supposed to be a raw-measurement display primitive, so it is
    gone — high-altitude targets now sit a few km outside the drawn arc,
    on purpose, and the 2-D ground-plane differential below is the only
    locus this builder ever solves.

    Differentials below ARC_MIN_DIFFERENTIAL_KM yield no arc at all: a
    near-baseline sliver conveys no positional information and renders as
    a misleading blob (see the constant's comment for the measurement).
