"""Shared health-check evaluation.

`compute_health_issues()` inspects live server state and returns a list of
structured issues. It is the single source of truth used by both the
`/api/health` endpoint (synchronous, on-demand) and the health-monitor task
(periodic, owns alerting). Keeping the logic here means the endpoint and the
alerter can never disagree about what "degraded" means.

Each issue is a dict: {"type": str, "severity": "critical"|"warning", "message": str}.
`type` is the stable alert key — alert dedup/cooldown is keyed on it, so it
includes enough context (e.g. the task name) to distinguish distinct problems.

# Fleet-average miss rate above which the network counts as blind.

# Deliberately above the band the network reports when it is working. The
# rate scores ADS-B aircraft inside a node's *theoretical* beam wedge against
# what its tracker actually detected, and for passive bistatic radar that
# wedge is a much larger set than what is physically detectable: low RCS,
# poor bistatic geometry, terrain and receiver sensitivity all put aircraft
# in the wedge that no node could see. So the rate has a high floor set by
# physics and siting rather than by health. Production reported 72-94%
# throughout, on a 27-node synthetic fleet and on the three real nodes that
# replaced it, flapping across the old 0.7 and costing a fire-and-resolve
# pair each crossing.
#
# Set clear of that band rather than just past it: the worst reading on
# record is 94%, so a boundary at 0.95 would leave one point of headroom and
# go on flapping on a bad day. What is left is a tripwire for a network that
# has actually gone blind, which is a reading near 100%.
#
# It is not a fix: no absolute threshold can be, because the floor moves with
# traffic, time of day and which nodes are up and where they point.
# Replacing the measure with one that tracks a node against its own history
# is ClickUp 86cb81gkn.
