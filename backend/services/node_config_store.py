"""Persisting a node's configuration, one append-only row per version.

Separate from `services/node_config.py`, which is a leaf on purpose: it takes a
dict and returns a dict, knowing nothing of identity or the database, and both
its callers depend on it staying that way. Versioning is the other half of the
job and needs a session, so it lives here.

Nothing commits. `mint_token`, `revoke_tokens` and this all flush and leave the
transaction to the route, so registration can write a node, an agreement set, a
config version, a revocation and a token as one unit.

Registration and PUT /v1/nodes/config both answer from here: a node that resends
an unchanged configuration must be told the version the server already holds
rather than a fresh one, and the two endpoints cannot be allowed to answer that
differently.
