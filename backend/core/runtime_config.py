"""Runtime-editable configuration files.

`backend/config/` holds source-controlled defaults that ship with the image.
`backend/data/runtime/` is the persistent overlay that the running app reads
and writes. Separating the two means the image's source code is never mixed
with mutable runtime state in the same Docker volume — which used to cause
stale-`constants.py` issues on deploys (see commit 19a305b).

On first startup `migrate_defaults_into_runtime()` seeds the runtime dir
from the legacy location, so existing deployments transition without any
manual intervention. After the seed, the runtime dir is authoritative and
the source-defaults dir is read-only template-only.

    """Write a runtime config file atomically.

    A plain open(path, "w") truncates before it writes, so a reader arriving
    mid-write sees an empty or partial file, and a crash or a full disk leaves
    one on disk for the next boot to choke on. Writing a sibling temp file and
    renaming it means a reader sees either the old content or the new, never a
    mix. The temp file is a sibling so the rename stays within one filesystem,
    which is what makes it atomic.

    The temp name is unique per call, not just per target. Two endpoints write
    tower_config.json, so with a shared name one caller's half-written temp file
    could be renamed into place by the other, putting content on disk that
    neither caller validated, and each caller's cleanup would delete the other's
    file out from under it. The cost of a unique name is that a process killed
    between the write and the rename leaves an orphan behind, where a shared
    name would have been reused by the next write; that is accepted, because an
    unreadable config is worse than a stray file.

    The content is flushed to disk before the rename, and the directory after it.
    Without the first, the rename can publish a file whose bytes have not landed,
    so a power loss leaves a config that is present, empty and unusable, which is
    the failure this function exists to prevent. Without the second, the rename
    itself may not survive, which is less serious (the reader still sees the old
    file rather than a broken one) but leaves the write silently undone.

    The encoding is pinned because the matching read pins it too, and the locale
    inside a container is often C, where the default is ASCII.
