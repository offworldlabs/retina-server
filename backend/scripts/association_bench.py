"""Offline benchmark for inter-node association: how many tracks are false?

Why this exists
---------------
The false-track ("ghost") rate cannot be measured on staging.  Sampling the
live feed gives a per-snapshot standard deviation of ~25 points on a metric
whose interesting differences are 10-20 points, and it drifts systematically
with fleet age -- a 40-sample window read 3% and a 70-sample window read 50%
for identical code.  Two algorithm changes were evaluated that way and both
conclusions were wrong, in opposite directions.

Nothing about the question needs a live fleet.  The simulator produces exactly
the frames the nodes send (`generate_detections_for_node` is the same call the
fleet orchestrator makes), and it knows where every aircraft actually is.  So
the whole pipeline -- world, detections, association, solve -- runs offline,
deterministically under a seed, in seconds.

A "ghost" here is a solve with no true aircraft within MATCH_KM.  That is the
same criterion used against staging, so numbers are comparable to the
measurements already taken.

Runs blind by default: the per-detection ADS-B tags the simulator attaches are
stripped before association, because no receiver gets them and using them
amounts to reading the answer off the simulator.  See _strip_adsb -- it is the
difference between a 14% and a 79% ghost rate on identical scenes.  --tagged
restores the old behaviour for comparison.

Optionally, --mode track can also score every run against Stone-Soup's GOSPA
and SIAP metrics (scripts/stonesoup_metrics.py) -- an assignment-based
complement to the MATCH_KM ghost/matched counters above.  Where the counters
above answer one question decided in advance (is a solve within MATCH_KM of
some aircraft?), GOSPA decomposes a single distance into localisation/missed/
false costs via an optimal assignment at each sampled instant, and SIAP scores
completeness, ambiguity, spuriousness and track continuity the way the
tracking literature usually does -- a second, independently-implemented read
on the same runs.  This is entirely optional: stonesoup ships only in the
bench's own docker image, never in production's services/ dependencies, and
--ss-metrics defaults to "auto", which is silently off whenever stonesoup
is not importable or the run isn't --mode track.

# ── Overlap-zone memoization (bench-only monkeypatch) ────────────────────
# register_node recomputes compute_overlap_zone for every node pair (105
# pairs at 15 nodes; a 91x91x6 pure-Python grid sweep each) on every run()
# call, and identical fleets recur across --repeat seeds, the
# --assoc-interval/--chi2-max/--estimator sweeps in main(), and any
# in-process sweep driver that imports run() directly -- all rebuilding the
# same zones from scratch. compute_overlap_zone is referenced as a bare
# module-global inside InterNodeAssociator.register_node, so overwriting the
# name on retina_analytics.association intercepts every call
# DetectionAssociator makes (DetectionAssociator inherits register_node
# unchanged). This is safe because:
#   - OverlapZone is never mutated after construction: __post_init__ and the
#     idempotent _ensure_np() are the only writers, and _ensure_np derives
#     its arrays deterministically from delay_pairs, so one instance can be
#     shared across associators and runs with no risk of cross-run drift.
#   - The bench always constructs its associator with coverage_provider=None
#     and fov_provider=None, so geo.coverage_limit and geo.fov are always
#     None here. Both are dynamic, non-hashable inputs, so a real value on
#     either bypasses the cache below rather than being treated as
#     memoizable.
#   - compute_overlap_zone consumes no random state, so skipping it on a
#     cache hit cannot shift any downstream RNG draw.
