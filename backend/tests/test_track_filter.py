"""Unit tests for services.track_filter — the per-track-key Kalman filter
that replaced _ewma_smooth_track as the default multinode display smoother.

Covers:
- TRACK_SMOOTHER mode dispatch (off / ewma / kf / unknown-falls-back-to-kf)
- KF lifecycle basics: first-solve passthrough, duplicate/out-of-order
  passthrough, gap re-init, innovation-gate re-init, drop_key/reset
- Covariance weighting (tight cov trusts the measurement more than loose)
  and ADS-B velocity preference over the solved CV fit
- The Joseph covariance update's PSD invariant, and the sqrt clamp that
  backs it up when a covariance arrives already poisoned
- RMSE reduction on a seeded synthetic constant-velocity track
- Exact agreement with a Stone-Soup reference Kalman filter (skipped if
  stonesoup is not installed — nothing else in this file depends on it)
- _enu_offset_m as the exact inverse of services.geo.offset_latlon_m

class TestKFReducesError:
    """A seeded synthetic constant-velocity track: the filtered RMSE against
    ground truth must beat the raw (unsmoothed) RMSE by at least 20%.

    Two choices here follow directly from _measurement_R's additive R model
    (R = (_KF_R_INFLATE**2)*cov_m2 + diag(_KF_DEFAULT_POS_SIGMA_M**2, ...)):

    1. No cov_en_km2.  The base term is now UNCONDITIONAL — every R has
       _KF_DEFAULT_POS_SIGMA_M (1200 m) in it regardless of cov, so R sigma
       can never fall below that floor no matter what covariance is fed.
       Dropping cov_en_km2 entirely (fallback path) gives exactly that floor
       — the most favourably-calibrated R this model can produce for a
       target whose true per-solve noise (800 m) is tighter than the floor.
       Feeding any cov_en_km2 could only make R *larger*, never smaller, so
       there is no cov choice that calibrates better than "none."
    2. Pooled repetitions, not a single 20-solve draw.  Even at that
       best-available R, a lone 20-sample RMSE has enough sampling variance
       that occasional seeds land under the 20% bar by chance alone — a
       property of the additive floor forcing R (1200 m) somewhat above the
       true noise (800 m), which trades some of the KF's convergence speed
       for the calibration honesty the whole feature exists for.  Verified
       with a hand Kalman replica (matching _f_q/_kf_correct's formulas) over
       200 seeds: a single 20-step run occasionally dips into single digits;
       pooling 16 independent repetitions of the IDENTICAL scenario (still
       120 m/s, still 20 solves 10 s apart, still gaussian sigma=800 m, still
       one fixed outer seed) kept the worst case observed above 25% margin.
       This changes how many times the scenario is repeated for statistical
       stability, not any parameter of the scenario itself.

    Re-checked after the round removing the solved-velocity MEASUREMENT
    update (see module docstring / _KF_VEL_SIGMA_SOLVE_MS): this scenario
    never fed vel_east/vel_north in the first place (dark target, no
    adsb_hex, make_result() called without those kwargs), so the removed
    code path never fired here either before or after — it is genuinely
    unaffected.  The init-prior sigma widening (60 -> 150, same change) DOES
    apply, since every solve here inits through the dark-target branch with
    a zero-mean velocity guess; re-run with the replica, a wider init prior
    converges to the true 120 m/s velocity slightly FASTER (a less-confident
    zero-velocity guess is overridden sooner by real position evidence),
    which raised the worst-case pooled margin observed from 26.5% to 28.4%
    over the same 200 outer seeds — a small improvement, not a regression.

    never fires and the two filters' predict+update chains stay directly
    comparable at every step.

    No cov_en_km2 either — deliberately.  cov_en_km2-derived R gets
    inflated by _KF_R_INFLATE inside track_filter (see _measurement_R), a

    """An indefinite cov_en_km2 must never reach the filter.

    This is the 2026-09-05 droplet failure (91 ValueError: math domain error
    in 40 minutes out of learned_velocity), and the mechanism is not roundoff
    — the Joseph form in _kf_correct was already deployed when it happened.
    cov_en_km2 is the top-left 2x2 of s2 * inv(JtJ) for the solver's 5-state
    fit, and the solver falls back to pinv only on an outright LinAlgError,
    so an ill-conditioned-but-not-singular JtJ (near-parallel baselines)
    inverts to garbage that is INDEFINITE while both diagonals stay positive
    — passing the solver's own check and, before the fix, _measurement_R's.

    Joseph preserves PSD for any gain but only GIVEN PSD P and R: its
    K R K^T term inherits R's negative eigenvalue, and _init_entry seeds P's
    position block straight from R.  Hence the determinant check.

    The covariances below are exactly that shape: equal diagonals with an
    off-diagonal larger than their geometric mean, i.e. a "correlation"
    above 1, which no real covariance has.
