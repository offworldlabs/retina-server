"""Tests for services/track_gates.py's coverage-calibration gate.

The detection area must be characterised by DETECTIONS, not by tracks that
merely still render.  A track keeps emitting for up to DISPLAY_STALE_TRACK_S
(15 s) after its last real detection with has_adsb still matching the live
ADS-B fix, so ungating calibration recording on that alone stamped positives
along an aircraft's exit path, far outside actual coverage, every emit cycle.
