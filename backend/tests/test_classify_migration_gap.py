"""deploy/classify-migration-gap.py, exercised as the CLI rollback.sh calls.

Run as a subprocess against a scratch git repository rather than imported. The
script's contract is its printed report and its exit status, and it reads the
repository from its working directory, so a subprocess is the only honest way
to point it at a tree built for a test.
