"""The generated node contract, and the properties that make it worth trusting.

`contracts/nodes-v1.openapi.yaml` is the wire contract: the node client and the
conformance harness are independent implementations of it. It is generated
rather than authored, so what wants testing is not its content but that it
still says what the server does — that nothing is published which no request can
reach, and that nothing the server enforces is quietly dropped on the way out.

The first test here is the same assertion CI makes. It is duplicated
deliberately: finding a stale contract at `pytest` time is a regeneration, and
finding it in CI is a round trip.
