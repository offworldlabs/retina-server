"""Registering a node must not stall the event loop, whichever path it arrives by.

`InterNodeAssociator.register_node` pre-computes an overlap grid against every
node already registered, which is seconds of CPU once a fleet is up. Called
straight from an `async def` handler that cost lands on the event loop, so it
does not merely slow the request that triggered it: every other request in
flight waits behind it. That is how a slow registration turned into a map with
nothing on it (86cb5hef4) — the ingest POSTs stopped returning inside the
client's 30 s timeout.

`services/tcp_handler.py` already dispatches registration to a dedicated
executor. These tests hold every other path to the same rule: both HTTP ingest
endpoints and the v1 pipeline path in `services/node_pipeline.py`.
