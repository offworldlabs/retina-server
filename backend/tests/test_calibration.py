"""One age rule for coverage calibration points.

The frame path and the solve path recorded these independently and disagreed on
the only parameter that matters: the solver gated at 10 s, the frame path used
_fresh_adsb's 60 s display-freshness window and applied no calibration gate at
all.  At 250 m/s that is 15 km of travel recorded against a 5-degree polar grid
whose entire purpose is to say where a node can see.

A second, independent rule lives here too: fix_ts/detection_ts and the
CAL_FIX_DETECTION_SKEW_S gate (TestFixDetectionSkewGate below).  age_s bounds
the fix against `now`; the skew gate bounds the fix against the DETECTION
EVENT it is meant to describe — a fix can be fresh by both age_s and
CAL_DETECTION_FRESH_S and still be an exit smear, the live position recorded
for a few seconds after the node actually lost the target.  See the module
docstring in services/calibration.py.
