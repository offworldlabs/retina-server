"""Cross-lib guard: the two WGS84 implementations must agree.

retina-tracker/geometry.py and retina-geolocator/Geometry.py each carry their
own ecef2lla (different iteration form, different pole handling).  Measured
over the CONUS operating envelope they agree to 5.6e-11 degrees, so neither
is replaced — but nothing guarded that agreement until this test.  Lives in
backend/tests because it is the one place both libraries are installed
together; the libs' own CI runs them in isolation.
