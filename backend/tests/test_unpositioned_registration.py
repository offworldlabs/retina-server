"""A node that registers without a position must join no overlap pairs.

`POST /api/radar/detections` has no config to offer for a node it has not seen
before, so it registers one with `{"node_id": ...}` and nothing else. Left to
default, that geometry is (0, 0): every such node lands on one footprint in the
Gulf of Guinea and overlaps every other one completely. The neighbour graph goes
complete, the associator fuses a dozen unrelated nodes into a single candidate,
and the solver queue backs up behind candidates that are pure artefact
(86cb5hef4).

The guard itself lives in retina-analytics (`has_full_geometry`), so what
is pinned here is the behaviour this repo depends on rather than its
implementation: nothing but the submodule revision stands between main and a
repeat, and the failure mode is a saturated solver rather than an exception.
