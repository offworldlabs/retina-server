"""POST /v1/nodes/register.

Three things are asserted here that are requirements rather than preferences,
and each has a test whose name says so: the rate limiter runs before the Mender
call, configuration validation runs after identity resolution, and every refusal
class answers with one body and one jittered Retry-After.

The re-registration tests stand in for the reflash path: a board that comes back
with the same node_id keeps its node_ref and its configuration version, and its
previous token dies. There is no heartbeat handler on this branch to spend the
dead token against, so the revocation is asserted through `bearer_node`, which
is the predicate every authenticated endpoint resolves through anyway.
