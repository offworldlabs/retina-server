"""Tests for the consensus hypothesis stage (solver.py's _consensus_select),
productionized from the bench-only consensus_estimator.py prototype.

Bench measurement (association_bench.py --estimator lm vs consensus-refine,
5 seeds x default + dense scenes): n>=3 ghost solves ~3x down (13-16 vs
~46), position error slightly better, zero real tracks lost, LM-equivalent
per-solve cost.  This module pins the production wiring: consensus runs
once at n>=3, ahead of the LM altitude sweep, and either filters the input
(active), records what it would have done without touching the input
(shadow), or is a no-op (off, the default) — the LM solve, its trimming,
and its gate stack are unchanged either way; see _consensus_select's
docstring for the fallback rules.
