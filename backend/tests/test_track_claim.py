"""The solver-side track claim — the selection that actually runs.

Production builds the associator with cv_fit=None, so its stage-2 hypothesis
selection never executes; _claim_track_pair is what arbitrates competing
explanations of a single-node track.  It had no tests.

The behaviour that needs pinning is not the competitive case, which is
straightforward, but what happens to a pairing across rounds: chi2 is refitted
every round over a growing epoch set, so the score of a *stable, winning*
pairing drifts.  The held score is a best-ever high-water mark, so upward drift
loses to the pairing's own earlier claim.

That reads as a bug and was investigated as one.  It is not: measured blind on
6 seeds, pooled and paired by seed, letting a pairing renew its own claim is
never better and worse on 5 of 6, costing 3.2 pooled points of track ghost
rate and 9.5 at n=2-only for no gain in real tracks — the renewal raises the
bar competitors must beat, tracks change hands more, and each hand-over
publishes another track.  These tests pin the hysteresis deliberately.  See
_claim_track_pair's docstring for the pooled numbers.
