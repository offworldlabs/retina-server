"""The two streaming-tag paths: POST /v1/nodes/detection and /v1/nodes/heartbeat.

The router carries no prefix: `routes/nodes.py` supplies it at mount. The
handlers land here; detection answers 202, heartbeat 200.

Detection is the hot path and writes nothing to the database. Twelve nodes at
the contract's 2 Hz ceiling would be twenty-four writes a second for data
nothing reads, so a frame costs two indexed reads (the token, then the node row)
and a queue push, and the node's own record of itself is updated once a minute
by the heartbeat instead.

Neither handler derives anything from an assumed send interval. A node has no
send timer: it POSTs once per frame blah2 produces, so the arrival rate is the
radar's frame rate and moves with load, clutter and the board. 2 Hz is the
ceiling the rate limit is sized against and nothing else.

_DETECTION_DESCRIPTION = """\
One frame per request. `delay`, `doppler`, `snr` and `adsb_hex` are parallel and must be the
same length. An empty frame is valid and worth sending.

## Sending behaviour

**One POST per frame blah2 produces, and never otherwise.** There is no timer and no
batching, so the arrival rate at the server is the radar's frame rate, which is set by how
long processing takes rather than by the configured CPI. One frame per CPI is the ceiling;
what is measured today is roughly half that, and it moves with load, clutter and the board.

**Latest wins.** At most one request in flight and no queue: while a POST is slow, a newer
frame replaces the pending one rather than joining a queue behind it, and a request past its
timeout is abandoned so the next frame goes in a fresh one. Gaps are therefore permanent by
design, which is the right trade for live tracking and is why `seq` and `boot_id` exist. The
server counts what was lost rather than pretending nothing was.

Backfilling on reconnect buys nothing. Multi-node association gates on the difference
between two frames' capture timestamps rather than on arrival, so a frame delivered late
carries an old `t` and is rejected by that gate instead of being paired against whatever is
current.

**One kept-alive TLS connection per node**, since the alternative is a handshake per frame.

## The response, and acting on it

Every response carries the derived state in full, restated each time rather than sent on
change, so anything the server needs to tell the node is repeated until the node notices.

Revocation is a `401` rather than a control field, because it has to work whether or not the
node is cooperating. The one thing to avoid is treating a `401` as a trigger to re-register:
that turns a deliberate revocation into a registration storm. It is the only response here
carrying `x-terminal: true`.
"""

_HEARTBEAT_DESCRIPTION = """\
Sent every 60 s from process start until shutdown, unconditionally: whether or not
detections are flowing, whether or not the last frame was empty, whether or not
`streaming_allowed` is false, and whether or not the node yet holds a `config_version`. The
last of those is why that field is nullable here. A node that cannot build a configuration
is the one most worth hearing from, and requiring a version would make it the one that goes
silent.

Apply a uniform random phase offset within the interval, so a fleet restarting together does
not settle into one bucket and post simultaneously every minute.

`node_ref` on the response is the only place the node learns its public identifier has
rotated. `config_stale` and `streaming_allowed` mean what they do on the detection ack, and
are repeated here so that a paused node still learns when it may resume.

`health`, `versions` and `errors` are accepted and diagnostic. The server does not decide
whether a node is working from them: `blah2: "up"` reads identically on a wedged node and a
working one, and what settles the question is the server's own record of frame arrivals.
