# ── The error taxonomy ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# Every refusal under the prefix carries the contract's `Error`, whose required
# key is `error`. Two framework responses were reaching the wire unconverted:
# the 401 `bearer_node` raises, and the 422 a request model raises before any
# handler runs. Both are `{"detail": ...}`, which the node client reads as an
# unknown error, and the 422 is not even a status the contract declares.
#
# Scoped to the prefix rather than global, and the delegation below is what
# scopes it: the rest of this API is not written to this taxonomy and its
# callers parse FastAPI's shape.

# `Error.error`'s and `Error.detail`'s bounds, which ErrorBody enforces.

# FastAPI's own detail when a request body cannot be read at all: a transport
# failure such as a client disconnecting mid-upload, not a JSON syntax error
# (which raises RequestValidationError and lands in _validation_refusal
# instead). Confirmed in fastapi.routing.get_request_handler, whose bare
# `except Exception` around the body read wraps anything but HTTPException and
# json.JSONDecodeError in this exact prose, as HTTPException(400, ...). It has
# spaces and capitals, so it never matches _SLUG, and the taxonomy's own
# fallback would then publish an undocumented `bad_request`. A node's remedy is
# the same as for a body that failed the schema, so it wears that slug instead.
