"""PUT /v1/nodes/config, where a node resends its full configuration.

The router carries no prefix: `routes/nodes.py` supplies it at mount. The
handler lands here and answers 200 on success.

Distinct from `services/node_config.py`, which validates a payload, and from
`services/node_config_store.py`, which versions it. Import both by their full
paths to keep them apart from this module.

Registration shares both, so the version this endpoint returns for an unchanged
resend is the one POST /v1/nodes/register would return.

The server creates a new version if the configuration differs from the active one, and
returns the active `config_version` either way. The node adopts whatever comes back and
stamps subsequent frames with it.

One thing to know: a configuration that moves the receiver a significant distance may
rotate the node's public `node_ref`, which the node learns from its next heartbeat. This
response does not mention it, and nothing about streaming depends on the node noticing.
