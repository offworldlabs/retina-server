"""Request and response models for the v1 node API.

These models are the wire contract rather than a transcription of one. It used
to be the other way round: the contract was a hand-written `nodes_api_v1.yml`
outside the repo and every bound here was copied from it. That file is retired,
and `contracts/nodes-v1.openapi.yaml` is generated from what is below, so a
bound changed here changes the published contract in the same commit.

Which raises the stakes rather than lowering them. The node client and the
conformance harness are independent implementations built against a pinned
version, so a bound is a promise to them: tightening one is a breaking change
and wants `NODE_API_VERSION` raised, not a quiet edit.

Request models forbid unknown keys, so the published schemas carry
`additionalProperties: false`. Response models do not, since this end emits them.
