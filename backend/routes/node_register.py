"""POST /v1/nodes/register, the one-off handshake that mints a node's token.

The router carries no prefix: `routes/nodes.py` supplies it at mount. The
handler lands here and answers 200 on success.

Two orderings in the handler are requirements rather than preferences, and each
is wrong in an obvious-looking alternative:

The rate limiter runs before the Mender call (D26), so an unauthenticated caller
cannot drive traffic at the Mender tenant by looping on registration.

Configuration validation runs after identity resolution. A 400 reachable ahead
of it would turn the difference between 400 and 403 into an oracle for which
node identities exist, which is the whole reason every refusal here shares one
body. `RegisterRequest.config` is untyped for the same reason: a Pydantic model
would 422 ahead of the handler and reintroduce the oracle from the framework
side.

The endpoint is unauthenticated, so the only thing standing between a stranger
and a node takeover is Mender acceptance plus the registration limiter. See the
re-registration comment below for what that buys and what it does not.

_DESCRIPTION = """\
Unauthenticated. Called once, when the node has a `node_id` but no token.

## Preconditions

The node must be enrolled with and accepted by Mender before it registers. The server asks
Mender directly, while the request is open, so a node registering in the gap between
enrolling and being accepted is refused and must retry.

## Failure handling

Registration failures are deliberately opaque: unknown device, device not yet accepted by
Mender, node already registered and holding a valid token, and an identity in cooldown all
answer the same `403`, at the same latency, with the same `Retry-After`. Rate limiting
answers it too. Each response carries `x-retry`, which is the field to act on.

Registration is limited per `node_id` at 5 an hour and 20 a day. An ordinary node uses a
handful of attempts in its lifetime, so this only bites a retry loop with no backoff, and
the backoff is worth making real and jittered: a CGNAT pool rebooting together is a case
the server is sized for, but a hot loop is not.

## Recovering a node that has lost its token

A reflashed board comes back with the same `node_id`, a new Mender keypair and no token. On
the wire that is indistinguishable from somebody enrolling a keypair of their own under that
identity, so registering again revokes the previous token and is alerted on. There is
nothing to build for it, but it is worth knowing when a reflashed board sits in a retry loop
and the logs say nothing useful: the reason is on the server side.
