"""What the four node endpoints publish for each failure, and the `x-` vocabulary.

The generated OpenAPI schema is the node API's wire contract (86cb2d059). A
schema carries shapes and status codes but not behaviour, and the half a node
acts on is behaviour: whether a refusal may be retried, and whether retrying can
ever help. That half lives here, on the response object it describes, so it
cannot drift from the route that raises it. A separate document saying "never
retry a 403" goes stale the moment something else starts raising 403.

`API_DESCRIPTION` below is the application's OpenAPI description, and so the
published contract's, which is where the vocabulary is defined for a reader.

API_DESCRIPTION = """\
The RETINA server's HTTP API. The paths under `/v1/nodes` are the RETINA node
ingest contract, generated from the server and versioned as a unit; everything
else is internal to the map, the dashboard and the admin surfaces. The tower
search this app was named for now lives in tower-finder-service, which every
vhost reaches directly through nginx.

## Error taxonomy

Every refusal under `/v1/nodes` carries `Error`, whose required key is `error`
and whose optional `detail` names a field rather than describing it. The rest of
this API answers in FastAPI's `{"detail": ...}`, which its own callers parse.

| Status | Means |
|---|---|
| `400` | The body was refused. `invalid_config` for a configuration that failed validation, `invalid_body` for one that failed the schema |
| `401` | The bearer token is bad, revoked or expired |
| `403` | Registration refused, without saying why |
| `409` | The frame names a `config_version` this server never issued |
| `413` | The body exceeded the cap for its path |
| `429` | Rate limited |

`403` is deliberately opaque: unknown device, not yet accepted by Mender,
already holding a valid token and in cooldown are one response, at one latency,
with one `Retry-After`. Registration is limited per `node_id` and answers that
same `403` rather than a `429`, since a distinct status would confirm to an
unauthenticated caller that the identity it named is one the server tracks.

A path under the prefix this server does not route, or a routed one called with
the wrong method, answers in this same taxonomy too, as `{"error": "not_found"}`
or `{"error": "method_not_allowed"}` respectively. Neither is a per-operation
response, so neither is declared on any individual operation below.

## Retry semantics: `x-retry` and `x-terminal`

OpenAPI has no vocabulary for either, so these two extensions are invented here
and carried on the response object. A node acts on a field rather than on
someone's reading of a paragraph.

`x-retry` says what may be done with the identical request:

| Value | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `never` | Resending it unchanged cannot succeed. Something has to change first, and the response's description says what |
| `retry-after` | Honour the `Retry-After` header, then retry, backing off with jitter |
| `backoff` | Retry with exponential backoff and jitter |

`x-terminal: true` says the condition will not clear by anything the node can do:
it needs an operator. Only a refused credential is terminal, and the response
that carries it is the one case where continuing to retry makes things worse.

## Body cap: `x-max-body-bytes`

Each operation carries `x-max-body-bytes`: the `Content-Length` ceiling checked
ahead of parsing, past which the request answers `413`. Declared on the
operation rather than the response, since it describes what the operation
accepts rather than how to react to a refusal.
