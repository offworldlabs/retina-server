"""Vulture dead-code whitelist.

Every name listed here is referenced dynamically — by FastAPI routing
machinery, Pydantic deserialization, Starlette middleware protocol, or by
tests that exercise the public API.  The gate runs with --min-confidence 60
so these suppressions are necessary to avoid false positives.

Add a name here only when you are certain it is NOT dead code but vulture
cannot see the usage statically.  Real dead code should be deleted, not
whitelisted.
