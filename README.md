# retina-server

This repo powers RETINA, a passive-radar system: receiver nodes detect aircraft
from reflections of broadcast transmitters, and the backend turns those
detections into live tracks shown on a web map. "Tower Finder" — the original
illuminator-search feature documented below — is one of several surfaces (along
with the live map and the admin dashboard).

## Tower Finder feature

Web application and API that helps passive radar operators find suitable broadcast tower illuminators near their location.

Given geographic coordinates, the system queries the [Maprad.io](https://maprad.io) transmitter database for nearby FM/VHF/UHF broadcast towers, then filters and ranks them by suitability for passive radar use.

## Quick Start

### Clone (with submodules)

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/offworldlabs/retina-server.git
cd retina-server

# If already cloned without --recursive:
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### Backend

```bash
just setup
```

That is the supported path: it initialises the submodules, builds the backend venv
with `uv`, installs all five `libs/` packages editable, seeds `backend/.env` from
the example, applies the database migrations (`backend/data/users.db` does not
exist yet on a fresh clone, and `create_all` no longer builds it outside the test
suite), and installs the frontend dependencies. Install all five even if you only
care about tower search: `retina-simulation` imports the other four, so a partial
install fails at import time rather than at use.

Then either run the whole local stack:

```bash
just up      # uvicorn + synthetic fleet + Vite, with hot reload
just status  # what is alive
just down    # stop it
```

or just the API on its own:

```bash
cd backend && .venv/bin/uvicorn main:app --reload
```

The API runs at `http://localhost:8000`. Interactive docs at `/docs`. Add your
Maprad.io API key to `backend/.env` for tower search; the live map does not need
it.

#### Database migrations

The schema is owned by Alembic (`backend/migrations/`). `create_all` runs only
in the test suite, which sets `RETINA_SCHEMA_SOURCE=create_all`; everywhere else
migrations are applied on every start, by `just up` locally (`just migrate` runs
it on its own) and by `deploy/start.sh` on every container boot. Pulling a branch
that adds a revision therefore needs nothing extra.

To change the schema, edit the models, then from `backend/`:

```bash
uv run alembic revision --autogenerate -m "what changed"
uv run alembic upgrade head
```

Review the generated file before committing. Anything other than `create_table`
must go through `op.batch_alter_table`, because SQLite cannot `ALTER`.
`RETINA_DB_PATH` points Alembic at a scratch file if you want to try a
migration without touching `backend/data/users.db`.

### Frontend

`just setup` already installed the dependencies, and `just up` runs this alongside
the backend. To run it on its own:

```bash
cd frontend && npm run dev
```

Opens at `http://localhost:5173`. API calls are proxied to the backend during
development.

## API

### The v1 node API

The four endpoints under `/v1/nodes` that receiver nodes talk to are a versioned
wire contract, published at [`contracts/nodes-v1.openapi.yaml`](contracts/nodes-v1.openapi.yaml).
The node client and the conformance harness are independent implementations of
it, so it is the one part of this API with consumers holding a pinned version.

That file is **generated, not written**. It comes from the routes and the
Pydantic models, and CI regenerates it and fails when it differs from what is
committed, which is what stops the file being edited to match a change instead of
the change being noticed. Change a node route, then:

```bash
cd backend && RETINA_ENV=dev .venv/bin/python -m scripts.generate_openapi
```

and commit the result alongside. Behaviour a schema cannot carry (whether a
refusal may be retried, and whether retrying can ever help) is annotated onto
the routes as `x-retry` and `x-terminal`, and the vocabulary is defined in the
contract's own description. A breaking change raises `NODE_API_VERSION` in
`backend/routes/nodes.py`.

## How Ranking Works

1. Fetch all FM, VHF and UHF transmitters within 80 km from Maprad.io
2. Discard towers whose estimated received power is below −95 dBm
3. Classify each tower by band (VHF / UHF / FM) and distance suitability:
   - **Too Close** (< 8 km) — direct signal may overwhelm the receiver
   - **Ideal** (8–30 km) — best bistatic geometry
   - **Good** (30–60 km) — workable
   - **Far** (> 60 km) — fallback only
4. Rank by: band preference (VHF → UHF → FM) → distance class → signal strength
5. Return top N results
