    # is the only thing that ever builds the dev schema: without it a fresh clone
    # boots against an empty file, and a tree that has just pulled a new revision
    # boots against a stale one — both failing later, on the first query to touch
    # the missing table or column, instead of here where the cause is obvious.
    # That is why `up` runs it on every start rather than `setup` running it
    # once, and it is the same reasoning that has deploy/start.sh migrate on
    # every container boot.
    #
    # A revision this tree cannot locate is not automatically fatal, for the
    # reason start.sh sets out at length: checking out an older branch is the dev
    # equivalent of a rollback, and a revision the older code never touches is
    # harmless to leave in place. Unlike a deploy, though, dev branches diverge,
    # so "a revision I do not recognise" does NOT imply "the database is ahead of
    # me" here — it is equally the shape of a sibling branch's revision, where
    # this tree's own tables and columns were never applied and booting gives the
    # "no such table" this recipe exists to prevent. Alembic reports both
    # identically, since the recorded revision is absent from the graph either
    # way, so the schema is asked instead: a rollback leaves a superset of what
    # the models want, a sibling leaves a gap. See scripts/check_schema.py.

# ── retina-test droplet ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# `deploy-test` deploys by rsync from the working tree, not by git. That is
# deliberate: staging and production deploy from `main` through CI precisely so
# nothing unreviewed reaches them, and the whole point of this recipe is to run a
# branch under load BEFORE it is reviewed. That rationale is unchanged, and this
# remains the droplet's primary path.
#
# The consequence is that what runs there is whatever was in your tree, including
# uncommitted edits, so `deploy-test-status` prints the local HEAD it was cut from
# and whether that tree was dirty. Read it as a label, not a guarantee.
#
# What HAS changed: the droplet is no longer git-free. .github/workflows/
# deploy-test.yml added a dispatch-only CI path that deploys a pushed ref by git,
# so that the production auto-rollback machinery can be exercised end to end
# without breaking production — pre-deploy.sh and rollback.sh are both git-based
# and cannot run on a tree with no .git.
#
# The `--exclude '.git'` below therefore now means "leave the clone alone" rather
# than "there deliberately is not one". Nothing about this recipe changes: rsync
# still never creates or deletes a .git, and the clone survives every sync.
#
# The earlier worry that a git remote would "invite pushing to it directly" is
# handled by what the remote IS — origin is the GitHub repo, so deploy-test.yml
# can only deploy a ref that has been pushed there. Reaching the droplet without
# review still means this recipe, which is the point.

# The ssh target for the test droplet. Overridable, and deliberately not a
# hostname or an address: this repo is public, so it should not be where anyone
# learns what the infrastructure is called or where it lives. Set RETINA_TEST_HOST
# to whatever your own ~/.ssh/config calls it.

    #
    # Rules are evaluated in the order given and the first match wins, which is
    # what makes the three groups below meaningful:
    #
    # 1. Protect the receiver's state and leave .git alone — the droplet is a
    #    clone (see the note above), and rsync must neither create nor touch one.
    # 2. Force back in the things git IGNORES but the build needs. rsync has no
    #    notion of "tracked anyway", which git does: a tracked file still ships
    #    even when a pattern matches it. Without these the gitignore filter below
    #    silently drops them and --delete removes them from the droplet.
    #      metro_tower_cache — tracked in retina-simulation, whose own .gitignore

    #      .gitkeep          — tracked placeholders inside ignored data dirs
    # 3. Honour .gitignore. This is a REMOTE host, and .gitignore marks paths as
    #    local-only precisely because they must not leave the machine —
    #    .github/instructions/, .github/prompts/ and .claude/ are labelled
    #    "server credentials, ops, private prompts — never push" in it. A
    #    hand-maintained exclude list silently ships every one of them the day
