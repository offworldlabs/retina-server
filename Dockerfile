# The pragma pins the Dockerfile frontend rather than leaving it to whatever the
# building daemon happens to bundle. The uv install below is a BuildKit feature,
# and the two build paths that matter, CI and `docker compose up -d --build` on
# the droplets, are both BuildKit-backed but not both the same version. Docker
# Hub is already a build-time dependency through the base images, so this adds
# no new one.

# runtime and is recompiled on every boot.
