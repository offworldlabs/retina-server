# ── DOCKER-USER boundary: the HTTP(S) ports reachable only from Cloudflare ──
# ufw cannot do this. nginx runs in a container with published ports, and Docker
# publishes a port by writing DNAT rules into nat/PREROUTING and filter rules
# into its own DOCKER chain off FORWARD. ufw's rules live in INPUT, which those
# packets never traverse.
#
# The proof is in production: setup-server.sh allows only 22, 80 and 443 and sets
# `ufw default deny incoming`, yet nodes reach :3012 continuously. They reach it
# because ufw is not in the path.
#
# DOCKER-USER is the chain Docker guarantees it will not rewrite, and it is
# traversed before the DOCKER chain.
#
# Port 3012 is deliberately untouched. Real nodes connect from arbitrary consumer
# addresses behind NAT and CGNAT, so no allowlist could include them. Adding a
# rule for 3012 here would strand the fleet.
#
# Port 80 is narrowed to Cloudflare rather than closed: every server block in the
# nginx template listens on it, including the redirect vhost.
#
# Port 8443 is tower-finder-service's own edge (its compose publishes it on
# every droplet). Cloudflare reaches it once the Origin Rule for the fleet's
# hostname rewrites the destination port; nothing else should. The edge already
# refuses peers without a Cloudflare client certificate at the application
# layer (403) — this rule is the packet-layer half of the same boundary, the
# one retina's own 443 gets from `ssl_verify_client on`. Droplet-local deploy
# probes are unaffected: every rule below is scoped to the external interface.
#
# Every rule here is scoped to the external interface with `-i`. DOCKER-USER
# hangs off FORWARD, which carries container→internet egress as well as inbound
# traffic to published ports; see resolve_external_if below for why an
# unqualified rule would sever the former.

# ── Which interface does the internet arrive on? ─────────────────────────────
# DOCKER-USER is reached from FORWARD, and FORWARD carries container→internet
# egress as well as inbound traffic to published ports. An unqualified
# `--dports 80,443 -j DROP` therefore matches an outbound HTTPS SYN from a
# container just as readily as an inbound one from a stranger: the packet is
# NEW so the conntrack RETURN above it does not match, and its source is a
# 172.x container address so no Cloudflare RETURN matches either. That would
# break `npm install` and `pip install` during `docker compose up --build`, and
# every backend call to api.adsb.lol, opensky-network.org, api.open-meteo.com
# and oauth2.googleapis.com — as a hang rather than an error, because DROP
# sends nothing back.
#
# Scoping every rule with `-i` fixes it: egress leaves via this interface (-o),
# it never arrives on it, so it can no longer match anything this script wrote.
#
# The name is read from the default route rather than hardcoded. These are
# DigitalOcean droplets and the answer is eth0 today, but that is a convention,
# not a guarantee — a rebuilt or migrated box can present a predictable name
# (ens3, enp0s3). Anything other than exactly one answer is fatal, and
# deliberately so: a rule bound to the wrong interface does not fail closed, it
# fails OPEN and silently — the DROP matches nothing, the origin serves the
# whole internet, and this script still prints ✓. Refusing to install is the
# strictly better outcome, because it is visible.
