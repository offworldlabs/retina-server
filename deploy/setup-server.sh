# ── retina-server: Full Server Setup + Security Hardening ──────────────────────
# Run this on a fresh Ubuntu 24.04 DigitalOcean droplet as root.
#
# Usage:
#   RADAR_API_KEY=... bash setup-server.sh                      # prod
#   RETINA_TARGET_ENV=test RADAR_API_KEY=... bash setup-server.sh
#
# Prerequisites:
#   - SSH access as root
#   - The repo should be copied to the server (via git clone, scp or the rsync
#     that `just deploy-test` does)
#   - A Cloudflare Origin cert at /etc/ssl/cloudflare/{cert,key}.pem BEFORE the
#     compose bring-up below, or nginx cannot bind 443 and the app crash-loops
set -euo pipefail

# Secrets come from the environment, not argv: keeps them out of `ps` output and
# shell history, and is order-independent (no positional-arg swap footgun). The
# `:?` form aborts with the given message if the var is unset or empty.

# (see the `cp deploy/env.*.example` below); hardening, docker and log rotation
# are identical everywhere. Defaults to prod so an unqualified run behaves as it
# always has. Validated here rather than left to `cp` to fail, so a typo names
# the valid values instead of reporting a missing file.

# Name the box after the environment it is becoming. The deploy workflow asserts
# this before it touches anything, because it is the one identity signal that

# provisioned box is in. Setting it here means a rebuild satisfies that check
# without anyone having to remember; skipping it would leave the next deploy to
# fail on a name the operator never knew mattered. Idempotent, like the rest.
