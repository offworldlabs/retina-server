"""Fail if a deployed environment has diverged from production anywhere it shouldn't.

Staging exists to catch problems before production sees them, which only works
while the two are the same everywhere that matters. They were not: staging had
no volume for the detection archive (so the dashboard's Data Explorer was
permanently empty), no Content-Security-Policy on any vhost, no /api/auth/ rate
limit, and no API key on the fleet's ingest — none of it deliberate, all of it
accumulated by editing two hand-maintained copies of the same config.

Production is the reference and every other deployed environment is compared
against it, rather than the environments being compared pairwise. That keeps one
answer to "what should this look like?" and means adding an environment costs one
line in OVERLAYS. The laptop overlay is deliberately absent: it has no
certificate, so it renders the template's plain-HTTP branch and could never match.

Two checks:

1. **Compose.** Merge base + each overlay via `docker compose config`, then walk
   both trees. Every leaf that differs must be covered by ALLOWED_DIVERGENCE.
   Anything else fails, naming the exact key path.

2. **nginx.** Render the shared template with each environment's HOST_* values,
   then rewrite every hostname back to a per-role token. The results must be
   byte-identical: same vhosts, same headers, same rate limits, same locations.
