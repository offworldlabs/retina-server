"""Render deploy/nginx/nginx.conf.template into a concrete nginx config.

One template serves every deployed environment; production and staging differ
only in the hostnames and the CSP's connect-src. This replaced a hand-maintained
nginx.conf + nginx-staging.conf pair that had silently diverged — staging had no
Content-Security-Policy on any vhost and no /api/auth/ rate limit, so both were
untested until a change reached production.

Three passes over the template:

0. ``# RETINA_IF <FLAG>`` / ``# RETINA_ELSE`` / ``# RETINA_ENDIF`` select between
   branches, and the marker lines themselves are dropped. The only flag today is
   ``TLS``, which the laptop turns off because it has no Cloudflare origin
   certificate and so cannot serve 443. It is deliberately opt-OUT: an unset or
   empty ``TLS_ENABLED`` means TLS stays on, so no environment can lose HTTPS by
   forgetting a variable — only by explicitly asking for plain HTTP. Any value
   other than true/false is an error rather than a silent default.

1. ``# RETINA_INCLUDE <path>`` lines are replaced by the contents of
   ``deploy/nginx/<path>``, preserving the marker's indentation. Snippets may
   include other snippets. This is a build-time inline rather than an nginx
   ``include`` directive on purpose: the rendered result is a single
   self-contained file written to the one path start.sh can write, and CI can
   diff two renders without a container or any nginx runtime state.

2. ``${VAR}`` is substituted for VAR in SUBSTITUTIONS — and *only* those. That
   allowlist is the whole point: a blanket substitution would also expand
   nginx's own runtime variables ($host, $remote_addr, $uri) and yield a config
   that parses cleanly while routing nothing correctly. Anything left looking
   like ``${...}`` after substitution is a typo, and is an error.

Usage:
    render-nginx-config.py <template> <output>          # values from os.environ
    render-nginx-config.py <template> <output> --env-file <file>
